Description
-----------
  Myasquo is an MySQL asyncronous queued library.
  It's main purpose is to provide async capabilities, reliability and simplicity.
  All the data that cannot be written will be backed up in the filesystem.

  This library is designed only for setting data, but not getting it - you cannot 
  get return value of the query.
